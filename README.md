# Pronounceable anagrams switched to C#

![](UML_pronounceable_anagrams.svg)

To-do :
- [ ] Add some kind of sorting according to the quantity of successive consonants or vowels (for now, as long as "aa" is valid, "aaaaaa" is also valid)
- [ ] Find better bigram/trigram sets for french words
- [X] Add an UI (using Unity ?)
- [ ] Study Markov chains and maybe add an option to generate words using this method
- [ ] The code rework is more permissive than the previous one, changing it again following a new system of rules and exceptions would probably be a better idea
- [ ] Update (re-do) the diagram
